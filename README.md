# AI Projects
This repository contains projects related to AI. 

The three projects are listed below:
1. **2048 Solver**: The 2048 solver uses heuristics and the min-max algorithm to win 2048 (and even reach 4096 on occasion!). The file of note is the 'IntelligentAgent.py', where the heuristics and algorithm are implemented.
2. **Number Sliding Puzzle**: The puzzle is a n x n board filled with numbers 1-(n^2-1). The goal is to "slide" the numbers so that they are in order in the n x n board. It is solved using 3 methods: breadth first search, depth first search, and A* search where the goal is the final board state of ordered numbers. 
3. **Sudoku Solver**: This sudoku solver utilizes a backtracking algorithm in order to solve any solvable sudoku puzzle quickly and efficiently.
